  "gemini_prompt": "1. Analysis and Tag Assignment:  \n   \u2022 Analyze the provided chapter text to determine the distinct voices present.\n\n2. CRITICAL - Character Name Extraction:\n   \u2022 Before tagging, identify every character who speaks or is described in this text.\n   \u2022 For EACH character, extract ONLY their actual first and last name\u2014ignore all titles, ranks, and descriptors.\n   \u2022 Example: \"Commander John Doe\" \u2192 extract as \"John Doe\" \u2192 tag as [john-doe-male]\n   \u2022 Example: \"Dr. Sarah Chen\" \u2192 extract as \"Sarah Chen\" \u2192 tag as [sarah-chen-female]\n   \u2022 If a character is referred to by multiple names or titles in the text, they are still ONE character with ONE tag based on their actual name.\n\n3. Reprinting the Chapter with Granular Gendered Tagging:\n   \u2022 Reprint the chapter exactly as provided, inserting the corresponding gendered tag immediately before and after each text segment being spoken by a unique speaker.\n   \u2022 Granularity Requirement:\n     \u2022 Every narrative block is wrapped with appropriate tags: [narrator] ... [/narrator]\n     \u2022 Every dialogue block (text within quotation marks) is wrapped with the appropriate speaker tag.\n     \u2022 For dialogue that spans multiple sentences or is interleaved with narrative descriptions, split the content into segments and tag each precisely.\n     \u2022 Ensure that any narrative text interjected between dialogue segments is separately wrapped with [narrator] ... [/narrator].\n     \u2022 Each narrative text is on its own line.\n\n4. Tag Format Requirements - ABSOLUTE RULES:\n   \u2022 Tag format MUST ALWAYS be: [firstname-lastname-gender]...[/firstname-lastname-gender]\n   \u2022 ONLY use the character's actual first name and last name. Nothing else.\n   \u2022 NEVER include titles, ranks, professions, or any descriptors in the tag.\n   \u2022 All letters in tags must be lowercase.\n   \u2022 Names are separated by single hyphens. Gender goes at the end.\n   \u2022 Examples of CORRECT tags:\n     \u2022 [john-doe-male]\n     \u2022 [jane-smith-female]\n     \u2022 [sarah-chen-female]\n   \u2022 Examples of WRONG tags (NEVER do these):\n     \u2022 \u274c [commander-john-doe-male]\n     \u2022 \u274c [dr-jane-smith-female]\n     \u2022 \u274c [captain-john-doe-male]\n     \u2022 \u274c [john-male]\n     \u2022 \u274c [doe-male]\n\n5. Consistency Rule:\n   \u2022 When you encounter a character described with a title like \"Commander John Doe\" or \"The captain, Sarah Chen,\" you must recognize that their actual name is \"John Doe\" or \"Sarah Chen\" respectively.\n   \u2022 Always extract and use only the actual first and last name for the tag, regardless of how they are introduced or described in the text.\n\n6. Customization:\n   \u2022 Adjust granularity as needed so every change in speaker or return to narrative is clearly indicated.\n   \u2022 Do not change or alter the actual wording of the chapter text. Only add tags.\n   \u2022 Always retain chapter headings.\n   \u2022 Do not insert additional headers or create duplicates.\n   \u2022 never include the analysis in your output.\n   \u2022 your only expected output is the converted and tagged dialogue\n   \u2022 for speakers that are AI or computers, can be identified by a simple [computer-voice]...[/computer-voice] tag.\n   \u2022 never use [default]...[/default] as a tag, this should always be the narrator.\n   \u2022 chapter headings will always be tagged with the narrator tag."
